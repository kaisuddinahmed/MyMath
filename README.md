# MyMath – AI Math Video Explainer for Primary Students

**MyMath** is an AI-powered math learning platform designed for primary school children (Grades 1–5).  
For every math problem, the system generates clear explanations and short visual videos to help children truly understand concepts instead of memorizing answers.

---

## ✨ Core Idea
Turn every math question into:
- Step-by-step explanation
- Visual object-based learning (blocks, fruits, fraction pies, number lines)
- Short auto-generated explanation video
- Practice questions for reinforcement

The goal is to build **strong math foundations** through clarity, visuals, and repetition.
